# Random Teleport Command

## Usage

1. 
```
/rtp
```
Default no args, will spawn the player at a gaussian random location within 0 to 10000 block radius

2. 
```
/rtp <radius>
```
radius integer argument, will spawn the player at a gaussian random location 0 to radius blocks away.
E.g.
```
/rtp 9999999
```
Note: The mod tries very hard not to spawn the player above water or underground, 99% of the time you'll be safe there are times when the player might spawn in an unsafe location. Be wary it can be dangerous.
